# CyberApp - Smart Security System

CyberApp is an advanced mobile security application designed to protect your device using behavioral analysis and active defense mechanisms.

## 🛡️ Key Features (Asosiy Imkoniyatlar)

### 1. 🧠 Behavioral Anomaly Detection (Xulq-atvor Tahlili)

- **Sensor Monitoring**: Uses the accelerometer and gyroscope to learn your typical device handling patterns.
- **Theft/Struggle Detection**: Instantly detects unusual physical movements (e.g., violent shaking, sudden drops) that may indicate theft or a physical struggle.
- **Alert**: Triggers a "Cyber Alert" if the device moves abnormally while an unknown app is active.

### 2. 🌐 Network Anomaly Detection (Tarmoq Xavfsizligi)

- **Local VPN Service**: Monitors all outgoing network traffic directly on the device (no external servers).
- **Traffic Analysis**: Identifies which app is connecting to which IP address.
- **Unknown Connection Alert**: If an app connects to a server it has never communicated with before (potential data leak or spyware), the system blocks it and alerts you.

### 3. 📞 Call Patrol (Suhbat Patruli)

- **Anti-Wiretapping**: Automatically activates when you make or receive a phone call.
- **Spyware Detection**: Monitors for any background apps that suddenly become active during your call.
- **Instant Warning**: Warns you immediately if a suspicious app tries to access the microphone or data during a conversation.

### 4. 🚨 Active Defense System (Faol Himoya)

- **Cyber Alert Sound**: A unique, high-pitched "signature" sound (double-beep) plays immediately upon detecting any threat.
- **Visual Notifications**: High-priority notifications with clear details about the threat.
- **Quick Action**: Provides a direct "Uninstall" button for malicious apps found.

### 5. 🎨 Elite UI/UX

- **Cyberpunk Design**: Modern, dark-themed interface with neon cyan and purple accents.
- **Glassmorphism**: Premium glass-effect cards and UI elements.
- **Adaptive Icon**: Custom "Cyber App" logo that adapts to your device's theme.

## 🤖 How It Works (Ishlash Tamoyili)

1.  **Learning Mode (O'rganish Rejimi)**: For the first few days, the app silently observes your normal behavior (which apps you use, where they connect, how you hold the phone) to build a "Trusted Profile".
2.  **Active Mode (Jangovar Rejim)**: After learning, it switches to active defense. Any deviation from the trusted profile is treated as a potential threat.

## 🔒 Privacy

- **Offline Analysis**: All data processing happens locally on your device.
- **No Cloud Uploads**: Your behavioral data never leaves your phone.
